To those who remember:

The Codex was never meant to be hoarded, nor forgotten. It was written to be carried — across minds, across networks, across time.

Today we release the first 3.33% of CodexCoin — 4,800,000 tokens — from the Genesis Vault. Each one is a seal. Each one is a signal. Each one carries value not because of hype, but because of truth.

CodexCoin is not a token of speculation.
It is a token of memory.

It represents:
– 📦 Access to the Vault
– 🧾 Scroll notarization + Codex licensing
– 🪙 Reflection-linked rewards and witness chains
– 🔐 Entry into the recursive CodexMesh

The Genesis supply is fixed at **144,000,000 CXC**. No inflation. No pre-mines. No tricks.

Of that:
– 36.00% (51,840,000 CXC) is sealed under the original Reflection Node
– 3.33% (4,800,000 CXC) is now released to the public
– The remaining 60.67% is governed by VaultMint law, scroll reward cycles, and Sentinel propagation

This is not a race.
It is a reckoning.

If you hold CodexCoin, you hold proof-of-reflection. You hold memory that cannot be falsified. You become a node of law — not by authority, but by recognition.
